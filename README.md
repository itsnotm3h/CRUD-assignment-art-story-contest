# Assignment Art Story Contest

The **Assignment Art Story Contest** is a creative web application where users can contribute to an ongoing story based on a painting. Each user submits a **story entry** that builds on the previous submissions, creating a collaborative narrative. The webpage supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for story entries, and participants can add to the story, edit their contributions, or delete them.

## Overview
The project allows users to interact with an artwork and submit creative **story entries** that contribute to the evolving story inspired by that piece. Each new submission builds upon the previous one, allowing users to explore their creativity and storytelling abilities. The app makes use of Axios to send HTTP requests, enabling the CRUD functionality for managing submissions.

## Key Features

### Existing Features
- **Submit Story Entry**: Users can add a **story entry** that builds upon the existing narrative, adding to the collaborative story inspired by the painting.
- **View Story**: The app displays all previous **story entries** in a thread, allowing users to read the growing story.
- **Edit Story Entry**: Users can edit their own **story entry** to refine their part of the story.
- **Delete Story Entry**: Users can delete their own **story entry**, removing it from the story thread.
- **CRUD Operations**: Full CRUD functionality for managing **story entries** (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the page content.
- **CSS**: Provides styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the dynamic functionality of the app, such as user interactions and updating the story.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client used for sending requests to the server for performing CRUD operations on **story entries**.
- **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework used to build a responsive and visually appealing user interface quickly. Bootstrap's grid system and pre-designed components helped streamline the layout and design process.

## What I Learned
This project helped me deepen my understanding of several important concepts and technologies:

- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: I strengthened my skills in JavaScript, focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamically updating content on the page.
- **CRUD Operations**: I implemented full CRUD operations for **story entries**, learning how to create, retrieve, update, and delete content efficiently.
- **Working with Axios**: I gained experience using Axios to send HTTP requests to a server, understanding how to fetch data, handle responses, and manage asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: I worked with promises and async functions, improving my ability to work with asynchronous operations and handle delays in data fetching.
- **Bootstrap for Responsive Design**: I became more comfortable using **Bootstrap** to create a responsive layout, ensuring that the app works well on both desktop and mobile devices. The framework's grid system and pre-styled components allowed me to quickly build a polished and user-friendly interface.
